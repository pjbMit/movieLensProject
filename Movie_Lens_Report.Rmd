## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





-----------------

June 2019

This is my Move Lens project for the Capstone Course in the HarvardX Data Science Certificate Program.

Student: Philip Brown 
email: Phil@pjb3.com
github: https://github.com/pjbMit

The project was created in the RStudio environment 
using Rstudio Version 1.1.442 
on a Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5

R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)  
nickname       Feather Spray

See the README.Rmd or README.html files for more information on the environment and setup.

For questions, email me:   pjbMit@pjb3.com  , and I'll gladly respond promptly.


---------------------------
1) Develop your algorithm using the edx set. 

2) For a final test of your algorithm, predict movie ratings in the validation set as if they were unknown.

3) RMSE will be used to evaluate how close your predictions are to the true values in the validation set.


## Set up.

Data is downloaded from  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/

and then a subset is selected by running this code which is given in the assignment's instructions:

Data setup

I needed to make two basic changes:
First) I needed to use a different repository to load the libraries, because repo specified didn't work on my mac.
Second) This R Code crashed RStudio repeatedly, so I created a function and added code to save objects as files,
        so that I could save intermediate results into a file, and then reload them if and as necessary if R crashed.
With these two work-arounds, I was able to load and process all of the data without incident.
```{r}

#Function that if passed save==TRUE with save the object to the file.

#  if RStudio crashes, you can reload the objects already processed, and then
#  continue the scrit from there.

```



General approach:

For many approaches, I will first try on a very small data set, just to get the code working,
the re-run on a medium sized data set, and then when I am satisfied, run on the full edx training set.

Similarly, initially I will NOT do full cross-validation, but once I have code working, then I will.

SET UP libraries and enable turn multi-core processing 
for some of operations used by the caret package.


Now the edx object and the validation object are both saved on the file system, so as a short-cut I can reload
those objects from disk to run my code, rather than having to download and process the raw data multiple times
during development.

```{r}

#Load libraries, installing as necessary
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse", repos = repos)
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret", repos = repos)
if(!require(mlbench)) install.packages("mlbench", repos = repo)

# Multicore processing package for caret.
if(!require(doMC)) install.packages("doMC", repos = repos)
registerDoMC(cores=8)

#For ctree model.  See https://rpubs.com/chengjiun/52658
if(!require(party)) install.packages("party", repos = repos)

#Function to load the edx object from a saved file.
#This allows faster re-runs of the code, by avoiding downloading and re-processing
#the data through each development iteration.
restoreEdx <- function(loadFromFile){
    if(loadFromFile){
        edxFile <- "~/edxFile.rds"
        edx <- readRDS(edxFile)
    }
    edx
}

#Function to load the validation object from a saved file.
#This allows faster re-runs of the code, by avoiding downloading and re-processing
#the data through each development iteration.
restoreValidation <- function(loadFromFile){
    if(loadFromFile){
        validationFile <- "~/validationFile.rds"
        validation <- readRDS(validationFile)
    }
    validation
}

# Function to get the repository to use 
# Needed because on my Mac, the standard CRAN repository gave me errors.
getRepos <- function() {
    isMac <- TRUE
    #isMac <- FALSE  ##Set to false if you are NOT running on a Mac.
    ifelse(isMac,repo <- "https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/" , repo <- "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    }

repos <- getRepos() #Use a differnt repository for R packages if on the Mac


#Now define some utility functions and functions used to preProcess the data.

# Function that calls createDataPartition to return a subset of the data frame.
# Created so that I can develop the code on a subset of the training data, 
# so that the code will run faster during development
getSubset <- function(df,y,percent){
   #rows <- length(res[,1])
   # n <- as.integer(rows * percent)
   set.seed(1967) # For repeatability
   subset_index <- createDataPartition(y = y, times = 1, p = percent, list = FALSE)
   res <- df[subset_index,]
   res
}

# Function to process the data and return only the unique generes.
# Pares out the genere separator "|"
getAllGenres <- function(edxData) {
    edxData %>% separate_rows(genres, sep = "\\|") %>%
	group_by(genres) %>%
	summarize(count = n()) %>%
	arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
    select(genres)
}

#Function extractGenresData is used to convert each genre into its own column
#The function accepts then name of a single movie genere, and returns a vector of 1's and 0's
#indicating whether or not that genere name is part of the genres string from that movie
extractGenresData <- function(oneGenre,genresByMovie){
    #genresByMovie %>% filter( grepl(oneGenre, genresByMovie$genres, fixed = TRUE))  # %>% count()
    res <- grepl(oneGenre, genresByMovie$genres, fixed = TRUE)
    sapply(res, as.numeric) ## Convert all logical values to numeric
}

## Function myPreProcess preprocesses the data.
## It Accepts the training data frame, and returns a new data frame
## containing the preProcessed data
myPreProcess <- function (data) {
    allGenres <- getAllGenres(data)   # gets all generes
    allGenresStr <- allGenres$genres  # A vector with one entry for each unique genere  
    rm(allGenres)
    genresByMovie <- data %>% select(genres) # string containing multiple generes with | separator
    oneRow <- extractGenresData("Comedy",genresByMovie)  #Get one row, just to test "extracting" one genre
    glimpse(oneRow)

    # For each movie, Extract genres into T/F columns
    genreDf <- as_tibble(sapply(allGenresStr,extractGenresData,genresByMovie)) 
    rm(allGenresStr)
    
    dim(genreDf)  #Just to see the value

    #Now convert certain fields to factors, since they are intended as labels, and not meaningful numeric values.
    factors <- data  %>%
    transmute(userId=userId,
              movieId=movieId,
              titleId=as.factor(title),
              genres=as.factor(genres))
    dim(factors) #just to see the value
    
    # Get the movie data with factors and genres, 
    # and add the rating, which is the random variable we want to predict, as the last column
    moviesWithGenre <- cbind(factors,genreDf,tibble(test=data$test)) %>% 
                        mutate(rating=data$rating)
    moviesWithGenre #And return the now preProcessed data frame that is the result.
}

#
# Function getData is used to run the code on a subset of the data
# during development, so that the code runs faster.
# This function will either return the data pased,
# or  a subset of the data based on the value of returnSubSet  second parameter
#
getData <- function (data,returnSubSet) {
 myData <- data
 if(returnSubSet) 
   { #Only use a Subset if in development
    percent <- 0.001
    #percent <- 0.01
    dataSubset <- getSubset(data,edx$rating,percent)
    myData <- dataSubset
    
    }
myData  #Return the data
}

```

The code below will load the edx and validation data from local files, after it has been downloaded, processed and saved per the instructions provided.  You can re-run this chunk of code to reload the data, rather than download and process it
again.
```{r}

loadFromFile <- FALSE
loadFromFile <- TRUE  ## Comment out this line if we don't want to reload the ojbects from files

# load the data from the saved file
edx <- restoreEdx(loadFromFile)
validation <- restoreValidation(loadFromFile)

```


PreProcess the data.
During development, only preprocess a subset of the data so that code runs quickly.
Run on the full set of data once development is completed, and it works.

```{r}

##Preprocess and get either the training data, or a subset it, depending on the value of inDevlopment.


# To make computations faster,
# only use a small subset of the training data for now.
# Later, re-run the code using the full training set once everything works.

inDevelopment <- FALSE # TRUE/FALSE value to only use a subset of data during development
inDevelopment <- TRUE  # To use the full training set, comment out this line and re-run the code.
 

data <- getData(edx,inDevelopment)  # Get the training data, or a subset of it.
glimpse(data) 


d1 <- data %>% mutate(test=FALSE)
d2 <- validation %>% mutate(test=TRUE)

movieDataWithGenre <- myPreProcess(rbind(d1,d2)) # Preprocess and get subsets of the data
glimpse(movieDataWithGenre)
myTrain <- movieDataWithGenre %>% filter(test==FALSE) %>% select (-test,-genres)
myTest  <- movieDataWithGenre %>% filter(test==TRUE) %>% select (-test) 

rm(d1,d2,movieDataWithGenre)
```

First look at the most naive approach... and notice that 3.51 is the mu_hat that has the lowest RMSE.
```{r}
# Using model Y_u_i = U + E_u_i
mu_hat <- mean(myTrain$rating)
mu_hat

#Function calculates RMSE, substituting zero as the error for NA rows
myRMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
    diff <- true_ratings - predicted_ratings
    #Replace NA with zero
    diff[is.na(diff)]<-0
    sqrt(mean((diff)^2))
  }

naive_rmse <- myRMSE(myTest$rating, mu_hat)

#Now create a results table, so that we can compare different approaches
rmse_results <- tibble(method = "Just the average", RMSE = naive_rmse)
rmse_results

# See how any other value increase or RMSE
#errors<-sapply(seq(2.5,4,.01),function(mu_hat) RMSE(myTest$rating, mu_hat))
#plot(seq(2.5,4,.01),errors)

mu <- mean(myTrain$rating) 
movie_avgs <- myTrain %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(b_i = mean(rating - mu))

#movie_avgs %>% qplot(b_i, geom ="histogram", bins = 10, data = ., color = I("black"))

predicted_ratings <- mu + myTest %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  pull(b_i)
predicted_ratings[is.na(predicted_ratings)]<-mu  ## use the mu_hat for any NA values
#predicted_ratings <- tibble(rating=predicted_ratings) ## Get predicted ratings

model_1_rmse <- myRMSE(predicted_ratings, myTest$rating)

rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          tibble(method="Movie Effect Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_1_rmse))
rmse_results 

user_avgs <- myTrain %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  summarize(b_u = mean(rating - mu - b_i))

sum(user_avgs$b_u[is.na(user_avgs$b_u)])  #Check for NA's
 
predicted_ratings <- myTest %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  left_join(user_avgs, by='userId') %>%
  mutate(pred = mu + b_i + b_u) %>%
  pull(pred)

model_2_rmse <- myRMSE(predicted_ratings, myTest$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          tibble(method="Movie + User Effects Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_2_rmse))

#Now We'll add regularization
lambda <- 3
mu <- mean(myTrain$rating)

movie_reg_avgs <- myTrain %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(b_i = sum(rating - mu)/(n()+lambda), n_i = n()) 

predicted_ratings <- myTest %>% 
  left_join(movie_reg_avgs, by = "movieId") %>%
  mutate(pred = mu + b_i) %>%
  pull(pred)

model_3_rmse <- myRMSE(predicted_ratings, myTest$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          tibble(method="Regularized Movie Effect Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_3_rmse))
rmse_results 
```
Now we will tune the parameter lambda.
```{r}
library(matrixStats)
library(tidyverse)
# The estimates that minimize this can be found similarly to what we did above. 
# Here we use cross-validation to pick a  λ 

lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)

qplot(lambdas, rmses)

My notes:

Don't use lm on huge datasets. Look at the alternatives using movie_avgs and user_avgs in the lectures.

34.7.5 Modeling movie effects

Don't use lm_fit with huge amounts of data. Checkout 34.7.5 Modeling movie effects in EDXdatasciencebook.pdf for an alternative.

Use Genres to improve RMSE scores.

https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.9x+2T2018/discussion/forum/1ae77f8b04e1c45e4b425cab952e4519ac2749f0/threads/5c7ac73b58adcb0994003491


R script = commented code 
Rmd = text + code + plots 
PDF = knit from Rmd

Test out tidyr::separate_rows(edx, genres, sep = "|") on a very small subset of edx and see what it is doing..


================
So I just finished up the machine learning class and started this one. I started on my project and have calculated and used b_i and b_u to inform my prediction. I was expecting to have to do more, but by rmse is already below 8.7, which exceeds our target. Have I messed something up? Will I be punished for having code that doesn't do everything the lessons did (regularization, genres, etc)?

Hi, You can try different methods and select one with the best performances with a reasonable explanation.


I just finished my analysis using the same two parameters, and was wondering if something was wrong as those two produce a reasonably good model per the rubric. I was going over the code time and again to make sure everything is right, and it appears to be. I am glad I am not the only one. For the record, I implemented regularization as well, but the improvement is not significant.

Don't use lm on huge datasets. Look at the alternatives using movie_avgs and user_avgs in the lectures.

One tip from me is for the genre effect. It is important to note that each user has a different genre effect. Note also that each movie has different genres. Finally and most importantly, treat genres as independent. That is, if a movie is having Romance|Comedy, then treat it as having both romance and comedy rather than Romance|Comedy as one unit. This is due to sparseness of the data. If you treat each combination of the genre as unique then there will be many genres and very few ratings in each genre. This will not give you a robust estimate.

Using this it was possible for me to go below 0.85 RMSE.                       

I used most of the same methods. I personally could have spent more time on the regularization, but my first guess at lambda got me under the the required RMSE so I called it good. One of my reviewers called me on it saying It was dumb luck and i should have used cross validation (they were right) but they gave me full points.

Look at the rubric and see what you are being graded against. There isn't a section for originality. So dont sweat it too much. Again save the fear for the choose your own project. I'm waiting on my staff review and its nerve racking.

#if you want to see the objects within a function, you have to use: lsos(pos = environment()), otherwise it'll only show #global variables. To write to standard error: write.table(lsos(pos=environment()), stderr(), quote=FALSE, sep='\t')

#I use the data.table package. With its := operator you can :

# Add columns by reference
# Modify subsets of existing columns by reference, and by group by reference
# Delete columns by reference
# None of these operations copy the (potentially large) data.table at all, not even once.
# 
# Aggregation is also particularly fast because data.table uses much less working memory.

## Use MCA to detemine which generes have the most influence
# Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

#Similar to PCA, but useful for categorical data.

#Required packages: spls
#
#Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection

#   method = 'leapSeq'
# Type: Regression
# 
# Tuning parameters:
# 
# nvmax (Maximum Number of Predictors)
# Required packages: leaps
# 
# Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection
# 
#   method = 'lmStepAIC'

===========




Do a PCA to determie best predictors...

Check to see if they are correllated, and remove if they are.

Use multiple models, and see if results improve.  Use an ensemble approach.

Tune parameters using cross-validation.

Use Regularization to limit effect of small data points

Use movie effect, user effect & genre effect to improve results.

Show plots to visualize results.
