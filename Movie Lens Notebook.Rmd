This is my Move Lens project for the Capstone Course in the HarvardX Data Science Certificate Program.

Student: Philip Brown
email: Phil@pjb3.com
github: https://github.com/pjbMit

The project was created in the RStudio environment 
using Rstudio Version 1.1.442 
on a Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5

R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)  
nickname       Feather Spray

The project uses packrat for dependancy management of all installed libraries



This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

---------------------------
1) Develop your algorithm using the edx set. 

2) For a final test of your algorithm, predict movie ratings in the validation set as if they were unknown.

3) RMSE will be used to evaluate how close your predictions are to the true values in the validation set.
