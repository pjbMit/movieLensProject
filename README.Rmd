## README file for 
## Machine Learning HarvardX Capstone Course:
## R Notebook for the Movie Lens Project 

### Philip Brown,  phil@pjb3.com,  pjbMit@pjb3.com

This is the README file for my Movie Lens project for the Capstone Course
in the HarvardX Data Science Certificate Program.

Student: Philip Brown

email: Phil@pjb3.com

github: https://github.com/pjbMit

The project was created in the RStudio environment 
using Rstudio Version 1.1.442 
on a Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5

R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) 

nickname       Feather Spray

The project uses **packrat** for dependancy management of all installed libraries.
Turn on packrat's "automatically snapshot local changes" feature 
from the "tools... Version Control ... Project Setup...Packrat..." menu
to automatically detect and create a new packrat snapshot everytime a library is added or updated.

For more packrat info see: 

  https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/walkthrough.html and 
  
  https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/rstudio.html and
  
  https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/
  

To set up the project in git:

 1) On gitHub, create a new empty repo.  
   
 2) Then copy the github https or ssh location of the repo.
   
 3) Open a command line in the local project directory and run a command such as:
        git remote add origin git@github.com:pjbMit/movieLensProject.git
        # Sets the new remote
        git remote -v
        # Verifies the new remote URL
        
  4) Commit files to your local git repository
    
  5) Now push those changes,  via 
        git push -u origin master
        # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
        
  6) You can now use the 'tools... version control...  commit" 
        and "tools.. version control... Push Branch" menu options to make local commits, and then push them to github.

## R Markdown

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

---------------------------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
